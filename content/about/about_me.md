Hi! My name is Dylan, and I'm a Software Engineer at the
[Alaska Satellite Facility](https://asf.alaska.edu), where I help maintain
[OpenScienceLab](https://opensciencelab.asf.alaska.edu), a JupyterHub-based
educational/research platform dedicated to processing Synthetic Aperture
Radar data.

Outside of work, I also enjoy film photography, playing guitar, and PC gaming.
