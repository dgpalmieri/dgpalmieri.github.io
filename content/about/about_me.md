Hi! My name is Dylan, and I'm a Computer Science Master's student at the
University of Alaska Fairbanks. I'm currently working at the
[Alaska Center for Energy and Power](https://acep.uaf.edu/) as a Graduate
Research Assistant, where I perform the duties of a DevOps Engineer.
In my spare time, I'm also the Vice-President of the
[UAF Cyber Security Club](https://csc.uaf.edu), where I focus primarily on
Linux Security and obscure distros. Outside of computer science/security, I
also enjoy film photography, playing guitar, and PC gaming.
